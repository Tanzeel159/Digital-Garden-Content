## Notes
- Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity
- with the advent of midjourney and other softwares that generate voice/video it's hard to distinguish media that is generated vs actual media
- C2PA(coalition of adobe, Microsoft and other giants) aims to solve that 
- add metadata to every media file
- use cryptography to generate unique hash/digitally sign
- any changes made to single pixel will be logged as new change
- first digital signature generated when image is captured
- 
- ![Future of Truth on Internet-1.png](./Attachments/Future%20of%20Truth%20on%20Internet-1.png)
- there are cons to the same effort such as using digital signature to verify who captured/created certain media and target him if they well he went against the govt/ their interests. (mass surveillance).

## Notes

### Interfaces : between users and tasks 

- We're designing interfaces, sure, but to design a good interface, we need to understand both the users goals and the tasks they're trying to accomplish.
- if we focus on task at hand rather than interface, we can come with some revolutionary designs just like Nest.

### Tips for identifying user task

1) **watch real users** - instead of speculating or brainstorming watch the users perform the task
2) **talk to them** - ask some users to perform task, talk to them, try understanding their goals, motives 
3) **start small** - start looking at small interactions , instead of having a wide view
4) **abstract up** - abstract up to a level you understand the task, keep asking until then
5) **you are not your user** - designing for others so leave your own previous experiences, perceived notions behind

### Usefulness and usability 

- **Useful** - interface allows user to achieve the task, usefulness is pretty low bar
- For ex - map helps us navigate, but we constantly need to keep track of where we are, our coordinates , plot our own route. 
- **Usability** - navigation apps
- we should focus on task at hand which is navigating .
- this helps us design better like navigation apps offloading cognitive load while driving 
- cognitive load - the total mental effort being used in working memory

### Exploring HCI : HCI Principles

| Bottom-Up                                                       | Top-Down                                                                                           |
| --------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| building up from low-level interactions to high-level effects ? | starting from the top with the desired outcome and making your way down to individual operations ? |
- Approach differs based on the situation and the outcome you want to achieve 
- 

| Different viewpoints                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| data visualizations - high level aggregation view -> granular view                                                                                       |
| designing for elderly, specially abled users - identifying the pain points, observing how they use , then using [predictor model](predictor%20model.md), [processor model](processor%20model.md) |
| having end vision of a result - gradually developing making changes along the way                                                                        |
| end result as starting point - do research. brainstorming , clear up gaps - cycle of [designing](designing.md),[testing](testing.md),[developing](developing.md)                            |
| Top - down for research and bottom up for development                                                                                                    |

### Views of the User : Processor 

- Important to understand role of the human in overall system
- Three ways it is possible
	- ![475](./Attachments/HCI%20-%20Design%20Principles%20and%20Feedback%20Cycles-2.png)
- Processor -> take input in and spit the output just like computer
- ![525](./Attachments/HCI%20-%20Design%20Principles%20and%20Feedback%20Cycles-4.png)
- **Interface within human limits :** what humans can sense, store in memory , physically do in the world. user can see colours, touch buttons etc.
- **evaluated by quantitative experiments :** numeric measurements of how quickly users react, complete task.
### Views of the User: Predictor

## Notes

- Whorfian hypothesis - language influences thinking
- native language helps us determine computational costs of different cognitive processes, and it influences ways of thinking - ex international students convert thoughts from native language into English and then share it
- more camel names, rice names - thought influenced language in this case
- languages have different sounds, vocabularies, structures 
- aboriginal community in Australia don't have left and right in their language, they use cardinal directions in their everyday communication
- cognitive ability across languages changes
- time is locked on landscape
- number trick - 8 penguins not all languages have translation of numbers 
- languages differ in dividing color spectrum as well - lots in some , others have just "light" & "dark", ex - Russians have separate terms of differentiating differ colors, when analyzed they are faster in differentiating colors compared to others
- surprised reaction in brain as color changes from light to dark color shift - categorical shift , no such brain activity for native English speakers
- structural quirks - sun masculine in India, feminine in German, it impacts how they describe things ( day-to-day interactions, poetry, song writing etc.)
- people pay attention to different things based on how their language shapes them - (English focusing on who did it, Spanish focusing on the event ) -> language guides reasoning 
- basic perceptual decisions, we make them every moment , languages slightly tweak the final decision 
- linguistic diversity reveals how flexible our human mind is
- As a trilingual, you watch movies from three different countries, read books from three different languages, learn cultures of three origins, and forge relationships with from diverse cultures. Indeed, when you learn a new language, you acquire a new reality of something different, or a soul. Knowing more than one or two languages also helps you understand the history of humanity and how some cultures and people act and think in different ways.

## Notes

shortlisting hotels 
priority matters - distance from venue
next strict filters - budget

things notices by others
site layout - amazon differs from the original brand site
colors used - yellow, green , blue - possible explanation has calming effect

decision making - aesthetics

can go both ways ... we usually recommend brand we have used in past , if aesthetics don't matter we don't include it in our search.

### Memory's role in search 
1) keeping tab open of tv we found and referencing it
2) past memories & future memories
3) cognitive offloading - compare in tables

primacy & recency effects 
serial position effect (Ebbinghaus) - usually items in the middle get picked

### social factors

holiday sales delay our decision of buying products

Summary: Google has announced its plan to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome by 2024 as part of its Privacy Sandbox initiative. The Tracking Protection feature will be rolled out starting January 4, 2024, with the aim of enhancing user privacy by limiting cross-site tracking and user surveillance. This move has received mixed reactions, with some seeing it as a step towards improving privacy and others expressing concerns about Google's dominance in the online advertising market. The phasing out of third-party cookies will have significant implications for digital marketing, and Google has stated that first-party data will become more important as part of its privacy initiatives.

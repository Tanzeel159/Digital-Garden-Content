Summary: Record players and other sound-producing devices rely on the principle of vibration to create sound. In the case of record players, a diaphragm attached to a stylus or needle vibrates in response to sound waves, cutting those vibrations into a wax record. When the record is played back, the needle follows the grooves, reproducing the original vibrations and creating sound. Modern record players use speakers and a copper coil vibrating between magnets to convert the vibrations into electricity, which is then amplified to produce sound. Other sound storage mediums, such as cassette tapes and CDs, use similar principles of magnetization and conversion of electrical signals to recreate sound.

## Highlights
- sound is just vibration ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72gpmgss8zmbw6q8xjzvny))
- ocus and direct the
  sound onto a diaphragm which is essentially just a fancy stretched out balloon from before the diaphragm would vibrate and attached to the diaphragm would be a stylus or needle that would cut these vibrations into a wax record creating a 3D line with bumps and valleys ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72jd1hxy4gp2g2mpy1fzf3))
- use that metal record as a stamp on Old plastic frisbees ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72kjr70nx63zsvsm43x0bj))
- drop the needle into the groove the bumps and valleys are going to cause that needle to make the exact same vibrations as the needle that recorded the original sound ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72mk7aq8qdmqetr5srbfqf))
- instead of a flimsy balloon it's a copper coil vibrating in between two magnets as the copper coil moves between the two magnets it makes electricity that goes to a speaker creating sound ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72n5kgw2wf199g1sbqnqfc))
- inside of the microphone you'll find a diaphragm that vibrates when you speak into it just like the balloon the diaphragm is either connected to a copper coil kind of like the record player where the sound vibrates the coil sending different strengths of electricity or the diaphragm is connected to a capacitor
  which is basically just a fancy plate as you speak the diaphragm moves and this vibration changes the distance causing a change in stored energy resulting again in different strengths of electricity ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72qhbxq461waaekp37c3e4))
- Magnetic Tape the paper the recording head is the point of contact the different strengths of electricity make changes to the magnetic fields on the tape surface this creates a little pattern of magnetization that
  almost exactly replicates the original sound wave ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72rf66tfkg51d8xvakfj8m))
- we take that electricity and convert it into ones and zeros ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72s891r2b2xne7pdef72jr))
- teeny laser we put these ones and zeros on a disc where pit represents a one and an untouched land represents a zero ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72sk2pa6znnj7e3q60yn4r))
- it's going to read it also with a laser this laser bounces off the CD if there's a pit it bounces a bit differently and writes down a one there's a land bounces the same and writes down a zero ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72t5apq1exzt1np4q7hpg3))
- we use a digital to analog converter but you can just call him DAC DAC will generate a certain amount of electricity depending on whether it reads a one or zero ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hk72tfs32h394at3zmezktm4))

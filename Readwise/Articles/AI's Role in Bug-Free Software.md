Summary: AI systems like Baldur are showing promise in automating the process of generating mathematical proofs for software verification. A team at the University of Massachusetts Amherst has developed a method using machine-checking, which involves creating a proof and then using a theorem prover to confirm its accuracy. They utilized an AI system called Baldur, which generates proofs and works with the theorem prover to check its work. When paired with the state-of-the-art tool for generating proofs, Thor, the success rate increases. Despite some errors, Baldur represents an effective and efficient method for verifying software correctness.

- The technique, known as machine-checking, involves creating a proof that the software performs as expected, and then using a theorem prover to confirm the proof's accuracy. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm0jyzqw22cq3dsw62w8qd1w))
- writing these proofs has been a laborious task, requiring extensive expertise and often resulting in proofs longer than the software code itself. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hm0jz6g4fxsm6pzq5jw7vw3c))

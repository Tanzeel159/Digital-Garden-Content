Summary: Cloudflare has won a trial against patent trolls Sable IP and Sable Networks. The jury found that Cloudflare did not infringe the patent asserted against them and further declared that Sable's patent claim was invalid and should never have been granted. This victory comes after years of litigation and the efforts of Cloudflare's legal team and Project Jengo participants, who provided prior art to invalidate Sable's patents. Cloudflare's success in this case sends a strong message to patent trolls and reaffirms their commitment to fighting against meritless claims.

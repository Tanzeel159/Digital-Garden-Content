Summary: 15 years ago, I helped design Google Maps.I still use it everyday.Last week, the team dramatically changed the map’s visual design.I don’t love it.It feels colder, less accurate and less human. But more importantly, they missed a key opportunity to simplify and scale.Google Maps has started to widely roll out updated map colors:All roads are now gray.Water changed from blue to teal. Parks and open spaces are now mint green. It seems the goal was to improve usability and make the maps more readable. Admittedly, I do think major roads, traffic, and trails stand out more now.But the colors of water and parks/open spaces blend together.And to me, the palette feels colder and more computer generated.But color choices aside… If the goal was better usability, the team missed a big opportunity:Google Maps should have cleaned up the crud overlaying the map.So much stuff has accumulated on top of the map.Currently there are ~11 different elements obscuring.

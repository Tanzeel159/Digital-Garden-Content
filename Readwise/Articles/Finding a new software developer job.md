- The advantage of the in-person interviews is that you get a better feel for the other person, and you can see what the office looks like. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3ahy0x3xcqw1zhdtph8ey))
- **Behavioral Questions**. These are questions of the form *“Tell me about a time when you disagreed with a coworker. How did you resolve it?”*. Typically, you should answer them using the STAR framework: Situation, Task, Action, Result, Reflection. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3bkt0b400sqzjf656myry))
- In the document I also wrote down little snippets of code in both Python and Go. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3d3a0r3yy90echammj830))
- I could refresh my memory and quickly come up with the right syntax in a coding interview. I ran all the snippets first, to see that I hadn’t made any mistake, and included relevant output. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3dfw8dz99qvbghbrf4n3f))
- Take-home assignments are a lot less stressful than live coding, but they also take much more time. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3mbq8scmn4mezgp4b7zes))
- A couple of times in the beginning, I gave too high of a salary number, resulting in cancelled interviews. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3ta9raak86wp4g6dz1622))
- So I changed my tactics to instead tell them what my salary had been each year for the past four years, to give them a sense of what I was ideally looking at ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3tpw94rj6rh4amjkzq1wa))
- Sometimes it also meant that I had a chance to show what I had to offer, which might later translate to a better offer than they initially intended. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3v0790qv4hs2s8b04g8h8))
- In the end, you also have to weigh other aspects of the job. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3x1399yr85nsmpyje83sq))
- How interesting is the product and company? What language will you work in? What will you learn? Who will your colleagues be? ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3x4qxxcqz5ht095pjg803))
- Even if you fail to get offers at most companies you apply to, you only need to have one where you are successful ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3ycwhjv0kmxpmqzg692ga))
- In a sense it is a numbers game – go through enough processes so that you get at least one offer. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk3yfa15tr332wg43fmesph))
- **Stressful.** Looking for a new job is a lot of work. It is hard to relax, even on weekends, because there is always some interview preparation you can do ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk41mqqg14kppqz8806vz7s))
- **Takes time.** I thought it would be quicker to find a new job. But there are four or five interviews to schedule, and often a take-home assignment to do. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk41ycrdwxmhc0z8jkvfd99))
- **A numbers game.** Even if you fail a lot of interviews, it only takes one company where you are successful ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk424w9n0t4wxt8mfttn76t))
- People to discuss with. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk42jt1mpm5vjxrr3jv9jq4))
- There are so many aspects to consider, and having somebody who understands to talk to helps immensely! ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk42mwrdyg8ba2b96mr2ynt))

- **Reach out.** If a colleague of yours is let go, reach out to them ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hpk431v8d3v15b00e8pycvmm))

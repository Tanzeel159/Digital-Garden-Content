## Notes

- ![HCI - Fundementals and Design.png](./Attachments/HCI%20-%20Fundementals%20and%20Design.png)
### Interaction

- It's frustrating when we spend more time figuring out how to use a software rather than focusing our time on accomplishing the task.
- As designers, we should address this - make the user feel they are interacting with the task , while our interface kind of vanishes behind (make it seamless).

![HCI Space](./Design%20for%20Accessibility.canvas.md)

### HCI vs Human Factors

- **Human factors engineering**  - designing interfaces between people and products, system 
- Example - consider an electric car 

| Human Factors Engineering | Human Computer Interaction |
| ---- | ---- |
| interested in how humans interact with non computer parts too  | interested just in how humans interact with computers present in the car |
| position of mirror, dashboard, height of seat | visualizing data on dashboard, control stereo system |

- We take the teachings of HFE and narrow it down for computer systems.
- Overtime HCI applications are growing and the gap between HFE and HCI is narrowing down.

### HCI vs User interface design

![HCI - Fundementals and Design-3.png](./Attachments/HCI%20-%20Fundementals%20and%20Design-3.png)

- UI Design - focus on on-screen interaction
- HCI - general methods applied to any interface

### HCI vs User experience design

- HCI - understanding interaction between humans and computers
- UX - dictating interactions between humans and computers
- symbiotic relationship 
- good design - understanding is correct 
- bad design - understanding is flawed, fix the issues and improve the design

### HCI vs Psychology 

- HCI takes form of software engineering 
- we use understanding of psychology, human perception, cognition to inform the designs 
- use these to reflect on our understanding of psychology

### HCI : Research & Design

- Research ([need finding](need%20finding.md), [prototyping](prototyping.md), [evaluation](evaluation.md))
- Design ([distributed cognition](distributed%20cognition.md), [mental models](mental%20models.md), [universal design](universal%20design.md))
- symbiotic relationship
- HCI : using research to define designs, using feedback from designs to inform our ongoing research

### Learning goals

- Design cycle : conception -> [prototyping](prototyping.md) -> [evaluation](evaluation.md)

### To design

- design - iterative process of needfinding, prototyping, evaluating, revising
- design has two forms : 
	- apply known principles to new problems
	- gather info, develop alternative designs, evaluate them accordingly

### Effectiveness

- what's our goal ? 
- most obvious : usability 
- other times : research (how users perceive something is working perfectly, make them intentionally harder , reduce carbon footprint, compare stats to neighbours show usage graphics )

### Between humans and computers

- goal shouldn't be to design thermostat, instead goal should be to design it in such a way user controls the temperature in better way . (Ex - Nest - automatically adjusts)

### Exploring HCI

- Technologies - new technological capabilities allowing us to design new user interactions
- domains - pre- existing areas that can be disrupted by computer interfaces like healthcare, education . 
- ideas - theories about how people interact with interfaces


### Ideas
#### Ubicomp and wearables

- Ubiquitous computing -> computing power anytime, anywhere

#### Robotics

- Human robot interaction
- equip robots to interact naturally with humans
- giving ability to learn 
- giving ability to teach humans
- loss of demand for  human labour - intersection of [Human Computer Interaction (HCI)](./Human%20Computer%20Interaction%20(HCI).md), [AI](AI.md), [Philosophy](Philosophy.md)
#### Mobile computing

- challenges : limited screen size, input methods are less precise
- opportunities : context-aware computing, AR![HCI - Introduction to HCI > Ubicomp and wearables](HCI%20-%20Introduction%20to%20HCI.md#Ubicomp%20and%20wearables)
- [why haven't phones replaced computers ?](why%20haven't%20phones%20replaced%20computers%20?.md)

#### Context - Sensitive Computing

- equipping user interfaces with historical, geographical or other forms of contextual knowledge
- perform certain action based on location (phone - open google maps when in car, put in silent mode when in meeting room)

#### Gesture based Interaction

- Interacting with interfaces using hand or body gestures 
- finger movements can support incredible number of interactions

#### Information Visualization 

- representing abstract data visually to help humans understand it .

#### CSCW (computer supported cooperative work)

- ![HCI - Fundementals and Design-5.png](./Attachments/HCI%20-%20Fundementals%20and%20Design-5.png)

#### Social computing 

- where computing intersects with our social lives - games, social media, dating apps, blogs

### Domain 

#### Special needs

- helping with special needs : ageing, injury, disability
- robotic prosthetic : neuroscience + engineering 
- it's important to understand how person intends to use such a limb (hci + robotics)
- communicating data visualization to blind people (through sound)

#### Education

- use HCI to introduce difficulties, design learning experiences for students 

#### Healthcare

- equipping doctors with patient data for diagnosis
- equipping patients with data to  better understand their body
- using VR to treat phobias, providing therapy -> help people confront their fears 

#### Security 

- security can be made usable with hci .
- if security methods come in the way of the people, they will simply ignore it risking online attacks. 
- captcha's earlier included writing down the text but now it's just a checkbox (mouse movement is tracked).
- system should specify to user why strong passwords are needed (mindset changes).
- games scoring how strong password is fun way to ease the users into security practices .

#### Games

- best example of hci.
- logical mapping between actions and effects
- feedback loop where user adjust actions based on gameplay 
- actions taken by user on controller should feel they are directly interacting with the game
- video game reviews mentions criticisms which are directly related to hci
- controls not easy to use, hard time navigating, penalty is high for loss

## Notes

- Record players and other sound-producing devices rely on the principle of vibration to create sound. 
- In the case of record players, a diaphragm attached to a stylus or needle vibrates in response to sound waves, cutting those vibrations into a wax record. 
- When the record is played back, the needle follows the grooves, reproducing the original vibrations and creating sound. 
- Modern record players use speakers and a copper coil vibrating between magnets to convert the vibrations into electricity, which is then amplified to produce sound. 
- Other sound storage mediums, such as cassette tapes and CDs, use similar principles of magnetization and conversion of electrical signals to recreate sound.

## Notes
- creating more optimal conditions increases the chances of luck as you are more likely to perform better in such scenarios. 
- Many people have binary view of luck ![450](./Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230508172036.png)
- Instead we should view it as a catchment area ![450](./Attachments/Pasted%20image%2020230508172127.png)
- Doing more things and making it visible to others opens up more opportunities. (ex create portfolio consisting of different projects covering different technologies or going deep in few of them and mastering those). 
- luck according to Naval: 
	1) Hope luck finds you
	2) Hustle until you find it
	3) Prepare the mind and be sensitive to chances others miss.
	4) Become the best at what you do. Refine what you do until this is true. Opportunity will seek you out. Luck becomes your destiny.

- **🌱 Accidental Luck**: You have the same luck as a plant. A plant does not move. Whether or not a plant does well pretty much just depends on where it’s seed lands.
- **🏃🏽‍♀️ Active Luck**: The luck you get from constantly moving around. There’s no particular direction in mind, but you’re more likely to find something good if you move around and explore instead of stay put and hope.
- **💊 Prepared Luck**: The luck you get from noticing that something lucky has happened, that most would miss.

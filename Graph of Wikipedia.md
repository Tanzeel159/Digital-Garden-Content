- most referenced articles include Covid 19, World War 1-2 , US is the most referenced article.  
- most contributions are by US .
- Wikipedia race - try to reach from one Wikipedia page to another just through links on the page, minimize the clicks it takes and in less time
- Does a path of links exist from every article to every other article on Wikipedia ? No because of orphan pages (no other article that link to them) 
- about 5% are orphans
- Dead-end (no links in page to other pages)
- Rest of the articles are well linked
